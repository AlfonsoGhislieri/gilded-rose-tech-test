# gilded-rose-tech-test

### Approach

I really had to plan and take this challenge on by breaking it down in seperate steps.

1. Write tests to cover all of the code
2. Break down the code to understand what each line did
3. Remove nested if statements to help make the code easier to read and follow
4. Create helper methods (increase_quality and decrease_quality) to change the quality of the items and decongest the code
5. Make a basic if elsif else block and put all the code together, making it easy to read.
6. Create classes for each item in order to push the logic out of the shop class.
7. Create a module to allow all classes to use same functions --> have access to same vars?
8. Added tests and implemented the conjured goods into the code
